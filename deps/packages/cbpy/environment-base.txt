# These are the packages we explicitly depend on. If you change these
# (packages OR versions), be sure to experimentally update the transitive
# dependencies below!
python=3.9.6
msgpack-python=1.0.2
natsort=7.1.1
python-snappy=0.6.0
requests=2.26.0
# Our "faked" dependencies. By convention these have an extra ".9" appended to
# the version number they're pretending to be. If we add more packages here in
# future, of course make sure they are NOT in the Black Duck manifest.
chardet=4.0.0.9
pip=21.0.1.9
readline=8.1.9
# These are transitive dependencies of the above. We keep them pinned to avoid
# surprises when newer versions are installed. Where possible we pin them to
# the same version in cbdeps.
#
# The best way to create/update this list is to run the commands in
# cbpy_unix.sh / cbpy_windows.bat by hand until the comment "Populate cbpy
# environment". Then run
#    conda install -y -c ./conda-pkgs \
#        python=3.9.5 chardet=4.0.0.9 ... # all explicit and faked deps
#    conda update --update-all
#    conda list
# This will need to be repeated on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, and
# Mac). Any resulting dependencies that are unique to specific platforms
# should be put into the corresponding environment-xxxxx.txt file rather
# than here; this file is for deps that are shared by all platforms.
