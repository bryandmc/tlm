Usage: install_hook.sh project [project ...]

Installs a pre-commit hook for the given projects to run

  git clang-format

before each commit.

Once installed, the behaviour of the hook can be customised with

  git config couchbase.clangformat <BEHAVIOUR>

Where the valid options are:

  "warn"   : Block the commit if there are style issues but do not make
             changes to files (default)
  "fix"    : Block the commit, Fix style issues but do not stage the
             resulting changes. Changes can be reviewed with \`git diff\`.
  "stage"  : Block, fix issues and immediately stage the changes
             ready to commit.
  "commit" : Transparently fix style issues and allow the commit.

In all cases except "warn", if clang-format refuses to run
(e.g., if it would modify files with unstaged changes) files
will not be changed and the commit will be refused. Stash any
unstaged changes you do not wish to commit in this case.
