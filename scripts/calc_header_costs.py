"""Calculate the costs of compiling headers; by considering how many
times each header is included compared to the time to compile it.

Requires two files:

1. Dependancy information for each target, so we can determine how
   many times each header is included. For example if using Ninja:

       $ ninja -t deps > deps.txt

2. List of costs of compiling each target. For example if using Ninja:

       show_ninja_build_stats < .ninja_log > costs.txt

Output:

Prints a list of all headers which have both cost and dependancy
information, of the form:

   total_time, header, count, cost_to_compile

total_time: 'count' * 'cost'. This attempts to measure the overall
            cost of this header across the whole build.
header: Path to header
count: Number of targets which depend on this header (i.e. how many
       times it is included)
cost_to_compile: time in seconds to compile this header.


By sorting by the first column one can identify potential build
hotspots. Either reduce the number of times they are included; or the
cost to compile to minimise the overall impact.
